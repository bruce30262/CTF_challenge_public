An interesting challenge while developing the assembler is that I have to think of a way to assemble the branch instruction. To jump to a specific location in EmojiVM, you'll have to push the location number to the stack then use ðŸš€(branch)/ðŸˆ¶(branch true)/ðŸˆš(branch false) to jump to that location. However it's not easy to implement that, since the instruction number ( amount of emojis ) will varied according to the location number.  
  
In the end I was able to solve it by assuming that "It will always spend 45 emojis while pushing the location number to the stack". I assumed that the code location in a emoji file will never exceed 99999, and to push 99999 ( the largest number ) to the VM stack, it'll spent about 45 emojis. So when the assembler tries to assemble a branch instruction, it will first generate 45 ðŸˆ³ (NOP) emoji and record the label's code position. After that, it'll overwrite those NOPs with the emoji code which will push the code location number to the VM stack. 

Of course this solution won't work if the emoji file has more than 1000000 emojis. However this is enough for us to solve the challenges.
